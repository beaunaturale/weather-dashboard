Challenge #6 Create weather dashboard using server-side APIs

Add 3rd party API - https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 to create a functioning 5-day weather app. Enter city into search box and click search. This will bring up the current weather details. INcluding date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. As well as the next 5 day forecast. 

No code was provided. Styling was done with Bootstrap. Utilized local storage to store previously searched city, and create button for easy access. Cities are being grabbed from th eAPI for continuity. However i could not solve for adding city button from the search trigger and buttons are generated once new city is searched.
